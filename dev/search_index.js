For example, the numerical values and the used units in this equation formulated for the submarine in the real application (P_mathrmapp = F_mathrmapp cdot V_mathrmapp) will often be different from the values and units for the scaled submarine model (P_mathrmmodel = F_mathrmmodel cdot V_mathrmmodel).
